CONSIDER:
- add support for prometheus pod monitor:
   - https://doc.crds.dev/github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator/monitoring.coreos.com/PodMonitor/v1@v0.76.0#spec-podMetricsEndpoints-tlsConfig-ca
   - inject trust bundle into ConfigMap that we refer to using the PodMonitor object
- reconsider leader election system
- reconsider what keys to use in the Secret
   - we should try to make it possible to issue the CA using cert-manager
- consider adding different sources:
   - dynamic self-signed
   - dynamic cert-manager
   - static filesystem
- improve the UX: in the example make the config more transparent (eg. configure Secret name through flag)
